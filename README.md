# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkWorkshopStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

Once you deploy the content of this proyect you will have the following infrastructure

These constructs can be attached to any Lambda function thatâ€™s used as an API Gateway backend, and it will count how many requests were issued to each URL path. It will store this in a DynamoDB table.

Also I used another construct library called CDK-DYNAMO-TABLE-VIEWER. This library allow you to check the number of hits that each path received and are stored in the dynamoDb table.
